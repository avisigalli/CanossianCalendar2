            <p>Thoughts by St. Magdalene di Canossa on your smartphone</p>
            <p> Our history </p>
              <p> <b> Magdalene </b> was born from the Marquis Canossa family in Verona on March 1, 1774. <br>
                She lives as a protagonist in an era of profound and radical cultural changes as well as political and social. <br>
                Sensitive to the needs of the poor people of the city and guided by a deep religious search, finds with difficulty, through many experiences and attempts, her charism in the Church: she will choose to live for God only not following the monastic form, but in dedication and service of the poor people, providing education to promote their autonomy, contributing to the work of evangelization of the Church and taking care of situations of fragility and abandonment. <br>
                She left Palazzo Canossa definitively and began her work with some companions, collecting and educating children in the degraded district of S. Zeno, on May 8, 1808. <br>
                Subsequently, the <b> Institute of the Daughters of Charity </b> extends to Venice, Milan, Bergamo, Trento, while Magdalene multiplies contacts with religious and civil authorities to support their own and other charitable initiatives.
                On May 23, 1831, with the help of a Venetian priest and two lay people from Bergamo, she founded the congregation of the Sons of Charity. <br>
                It involves countless laypeople in its broad apostolic plan, making them co-responsible in promoting charity.
                She died in Verona on 10 April 1835. <br>
                She was beatified by <b> Pius XI </b> on December 8, 1941 and canonized by <b> John Paul II </b> on October 2, 1988. </p>

                <p>A CALENDAR marks out TIME:<br>
    <b>CHRONOS</b> is logical and sequential time;<br>
    <b>KAIROS</b> is the right and favourable time, it is God's time;<br>
    a period of indefinite time in which "something" special happens.</p>

<p>While Chronos is quantitative, Kairos is of a qualitative nature.<br>
    In the history of salvation <b>God</b> freely thinks up a series of interventions which unfold in particular moments and these interventions are related to one another for the realization of a design.<br>
    <b>JESUS CHRIST</b>, the fullness of time, gives full meaning to the temporal, spatial and creatural dimension.<br>
    Revelation presents itself, thus, as the history of continual irruption of a concrete
    presence, <b>God</b>, in space and time so as to encounter real people from whom He wishes a free decision of love in order to carry out His design of love.</p>
<p>Biblical time is measured by <b>God's Word</b> and by the obedience of His people, where the
human creature expresses, in fullness, the faculty of a human being-who-decides.<br>
All Revelation rests on history, history in continual unfolding, but which has a long past and
it will be fulfilled in the future, the history of God's free and merciful interventions in the world
    and the human beings free response.</p>
<p>A Question: How did Jesus live time?<br>
<b>Jesus</b> gave His time to prayer.
<b>Jesus</b> gave His time to the poor, the sick and the suffering.
<b>Jesus</b> gave time to the Word, to the ministry of the Word.
<b>Jesus</b> gave much time to the formation of the Apostles.
<b>Jesus</b> gave much time to personal encounters of different types.
<b>Jesus</b> gave priority to the use of time.
<b>Jesus</b> had a clear vision of His mission.
<b>Jesus</b> had a precise knowledge of the use of time.
    <b>Jesus</b> took Himself away from His occupations so as to pray and to be with His apostles.</p>
<p><b>Magdalene of Canossa</b>:
"This situation is in God's hands; we must wait for the opportune moment of Divine Providence."<br>
"Now is the time to do what one can, until God removes these difficult circumstances."<br>
"Put yourself in the hands of the Lord who will make everything turn out for your good."<br>
"Abandon yourself in the Lord's hands because in His time, He will provide for everything."<br>
"Let us place ourselves in His hands, waiting for what He has planned for us."<br>
    "Time will settle everything."</p>
<p><b>Don Libera</b>:<br>
"How can you doubt that at the opportune time He will reveal His living designs?"<br>
    "We want to hope that God, at the opportune time, will grant our desires."</p>
<p>In my life it is important that Chronos must be on the same wavelength as Kairos
in contemplating the moment when God enters time
and permeates history and my existence
with His Mystery of Grace and
    Salvation. AMEN!</p>

                        <p>Union with God lasted for about an hour and a half, with

                        <p>I returned to my retreat in Verona and it needed all the
strength of obedience to put me at peace. It seemed as
though I had neglected the good of souls and had given
into my own inclination though I had done nothing according to my own will.

                        <p>I felt my soul drawn to unite itself exteriorly with God as
God, that is as Spirit. A great interior peace swept over
me. After this experience I had such a longing for death
and Heaven. 
<b>Memoirs VI, 27.29</b> </p>
                        <p class=bibbia> Peace I leave to you, My own peace I give you, a peace

have been carried away with my soul. During that day I
felt so light-hearted in everything I had to do.
<b>Memoirs VI, 27</b> </p>

my peace.

			<h3> 1. Childhood </h3>
            <p> Magdalene was born in Verona in 1774 with a noble family, <b> Canossa </b>, a third-born daughter of <b> Ottavio and
            Teresa Szluha </b>. The family, after the death of the firstborn <b> Carlo Vincenzo </b>, in 1771, and the birth of the year
            following her daughter <b> Laura </b>, she awaited a male heir who could give continuity to the noble family. <br>
            For this reason the birth of <b> Magdalene </b> was not welcomed with joy: the first biographer, the <b> Bresciani </b>, writes in this regard:
            <i> "It was not too much to accept, nor too merry, to congratulate his birth, which, expecting
            at least at the second birth a child [...] and seen in exchange a little girl they remained mute and unhappy "</i>.
            The long-awaited male, <b> Bonifacio </b>, was born finally in 1776, followed by his sister <b> Rosa </b> in 1777 and
            <b> Eleonora </b> in 1779. <br>
            Precisely in 1779, on 5 October, the Marquis <b> Ottavio </b>, seized by an illness died near
            Recoaro where he was both for naturalistic studies and for spa treatments.
            At Palazzo Canossa the widow <b> Teresa </b> with five children remained, her brother-in-law bachelor <b> Gerolamo </b>, her father-in-law <b> Carlo </b>
            with his three brothers. <br>
            It was in this context, at the age of five, that <b> Magdalene </b>, as we learn from a letter he wrote
            after <b> padre Federici </b>, he had the intuition of <i> having the vocation of becoming a nun, but without particularity of
            religion "</i>. <br>
            The <b> mother of Magdalene </b>, the only woman in the house, very young, with an imperfect knowledge of Italian
            and a different mentality was increasingly marginalized, so much so that the Canossa family, to guarantee and
            protect his family, appointed <b> Uncle Gerolamo </b> as guardian of the five orphans. </p>
			<p> It is therefore not surprising that, just two years after the death of her husband and despite the five children to be cared for, on August 25, 1781, the young Countess decided, after asking her father-in-law's consent, to remarry
            with the Marquis <b> Edoardo Zenetti </b>, leaving his sons at the Palazzo Canossa. <br>
            <b> Magdalene </b> after having experienced, at birth, a certain refusal, because they were waiting for a son, and
            at the age of 5, the loss, due to the sudden death of his father, now, at only 7 years, he was living,
            as a consequence of the decision of the mother, the abandonment. <br>
            According to <b> Rigo </b> this generated an oral-abbandodic character in the marchesine that led to the presumption of a
            <i> "very negative development prognosis" </i>. <br>
            After the mother's departure, <b> Bonifacio </b> was entrusted to a private tutor, <b> don Pietro Rossi </b>, because
            he provided the boy with a good culture and a solid moral direction that would enable him to administer
            the economic interests of the family and to participate actively in the political and civil life of his city. <br>
            Of the formation of the girls, who had to learn French, drawing, dance music, some works
            women and catechism, she was in charge <b> Francesca Marianna Capron </b>, <i> "a very accomplished lady, cultured, pious,
            sensible. Such at least were appearances, according to the information </i>.
            The governess, according to what the biographers affirm in agreement, did not have a good relationship with Magdalene, it even seems to mistreat her, tormenting her and exaggerating hers small shortcomings and
            above all, what is more serious, not loving her. </p>

			<h3> 2. The vocational choice and the beginning of discernment </h3>
            <p> In 1789, after seven years of service at the Canossa house, <b> Capron abandoned </b> the task to marry
            with <b> Giuseppe Mondini </b>, Italian teacher of the girls.
            In the same year, after the departure of the <b> Capron </b>, <b> a serious illness, almost deadly, hit Magdalene </b>
            he was only 15 years old. <br>
            He had a fever so high that "in seven days" it was a matter of burying it ", then a terrible sciatica.
            and finally a serious form of smallpox, it took a year for <b> Magdalene </b> to recover from that disease which, as
            he had to say later, not only had he marked her body, with a permanent contraction of the arms, but also the spirit,
            with the <i> "renewal" </i> and the <i> "resolution of the old feeling of remaining in the virginal state" </i>. </p>
            <p> After a year, <b> Magdalene </b> communicated to her brother's tutor, <b> don Pietro Rossi </b>, this decision, which
            he had never shared with anyone, not even with his confessor <b> father Ildelfonso of the Conception </b>. <br>
            He began to read the <b> Rules of Santa Chiara </b> that the <i> "quieted" </i>, then, more to please <b> don Pietro Rossi </b>
            who, by his own wish, read also the <b> Rules of the Discalced Carmelite Nuns </b> that <i> "both met and felt so much
            inclined to embrace them that only thought to facilitate the way ". </i>
            In the meantime, the <b> uncle Gerolamo </b> married the <b> contessina Claudia Marietta Buri </b>, died the <b> great-uncle Luigi </b>, and the
            sister <b> Laura </b> became engaged to the <b> marquis Antonio Maffei </b>. <br>
            For <i> "to escape from the whispers and the occasions in which it was after the engagement of the sister Laura" </i> <b> Magdalene </b>,
            he communicated his choice to the family and, advised by his confessor, on May 12, 1791, he entered the monastery of Santa Teresa
            outside Porta Romana in Verona, where he stayed for ten months. <br>
            Probably the <i> "horror of the Clausura" </i> and the <i> "singular genius for the infirm" </i> induced <b> Sister Maria Luigia della Croce </b>,
            teacher of the teachers, to recommend <b> Magdalene </b> to return to the palace, but her confessor, convinced of his call to life
            cloistered, forced her to obey, at the end of June 1792, in the Discalced Carmelites of Conegliano, where
            he stayed for only three days. </p>
			<p> <i> "We would certainly define a confessor's mistake to have sent Magdalene to Carmel.
            in addition to considering that there were no Italian Institutes of active life then, we could understand the
            choice if we consider how Magdalene manifested a spirituality with strong contemplative tints "</i>. <br>
            So even though the marquis had understood that the monastery was <i> "yes, a place where it could have been
            to sanctify herself "</i>, but could not <i>" nor prevent sins, nor benefit the health of souls "</i>,
            he accepted the advice of his confessor, considering what he had only half-sensed in temptation,
            perhaps also because of a sort of personal insecurity deriving from her history. She herself, to her
            first experience in Carmel, he had written: <i> "it seems impossible to me that God calls in a state without
            give aid "</i>. <br>
            The state to which <b> Magdalene </b> was called was the virginal, not monastic, was that
            apostolic as well as contemplative, but it was certainly not possible for an 18-year-old girl
            to imagine that we could consecrate ourselves to the Lord in another form, without entering into a monastery. <br>
            Providentially God, with an <i> "unexpected means, cut off the road and was forced to abandon
            that vocation ". </i> We do not know what was the <i>" unexpected means "</i> used by God that induced Magdalene,
            after being <i> "very resolute match" </i> to wear the dress, after saying goodbye to the mother, after
            having compromised twice in his social environment, entering the monastery, leaving it
            definitely. </p>
            <p> Returning, after the second vocational failure, the palace <b> Magdalene </b> was surrounded by judgments
            understandably unfavorable: it was considered superficial, voluble, even crazy. <br>
            The marquis had to re-read what happened, finding the sapiential meaning, the will of God, in this he helped her <b> Sr. Maria
            Luigia </b> in a letter dated August 20, 1792 in which he told her that the humiliation suffered was <i> "at present a means to
            begin his sanctification "</i> and that <i>" to have God manifested with evidence not wanting her Scalza, not the
            he already refuses for his wife "</i>. <br>
            Finally he advised her to entrust herself to the direction of <b> don Luigi Libera </b>, confessor of Terese, whom she had known
            during his stay in the monastery. </p>

				<h3> 3. The guide of Don Luigi Libera </h3>
                <p> The marquis received the indication of <b> Sister Maria Luigia </b> and with this humble priest began a patient
                path of vocational discernment. One year was taken between July 1792 and that of 1793, for
                understand the will of God <i> "without listening to any more favorable party" </i>, <i> "leaving
                aside every thought in relation to the vocation [monastic] "</i> because it is not yet <i>" knew what God had
                arranged for her ". </i> Magdalene, as evidenced by a short letter she had written to Aunt Matilde, on the 14th
                May 1791, when it was found by the Terese, it was prepared that: <i> "God would make His holy wish" </i>, but,
                then, he was not able to distinguish his own desires, his aspirations from the will of God who did not
                it was still manifested with clarity and completeness. For this don Libera had to place the marchesina
                to abandon their desires to try to find out, without the impatience of wanting to leave the state of
                precariousness in which his life was found, the vision of God on her, her vocation, her identity.
                To do so, he invited her, in an atmosphere of silence, prayer and charity, to <i> "interrogate" </i>, <i> "to try" </i> and <i> "to observe" </i>
                just heart because the <i> "seemed with all certainty that God held him in his hands" </i> and then you were
                to make <i> "a big account of his motions" </i>. <br>
                During this year of discernment, Magdalene changed the image she had of God, from demanding master to loving father.
                This enabled her to convert, not without difficulty, the anxiety of a Jansenistic perfection, which slipped into scruple,
                in an acceptance of his own fragility that led her to welcome, through a sincere openness to research
                of the will of God, his deepest identity as a daughter. </p>
                <p> But at the end of the year of prayer and discernment, despite the heart of <b> Magdalene </b>, according to <b> don
                Libera </b>, was <i> "attached to God and in possession of the truth" </i>, the state had not yet been identified
                of life in which God called her, even if there were, beyond the journey made, two clarity that the director le
                he communicated in a letter dated June 16, 1793: </p>
				<span> <i>
                I can not find in Her certain data and undoubted proofs of religious vocation; on the other side I see a stable abbreviation
                in the matrimonial state: therefore I say let's get in touch with that road, which does not close the door to any disposition
                that he could at the same time declare God on her person
                </i> </ span>
                <p> At this point Magdalene <i> tried to retire to a monastery without enclosure "</i>, probably the
                Convent of the Dimesse in Cittadella di Verona, <i> "for there to be waiting for the declaration of the will of
                God "</i>, but the family prevented him by considering it more appropriate to follow his sister <b> Rosa </b>, then sixteen,
                and who took care of the management of the house. <br>
                Naturally, as <b> Piccari </b>, a <b> Magdalene </b> <i> "affirmed, the solution caused a little anxiety,
                either because he lost every mirage of religious life at the moment, or because he was coming back, as they say,
                with feet on the ground at home "</i> in an indeterminate state of life. <br>
                Again <b> don Libera </b> provided <b> Magdalene </b> with a sapient reading of what happened, not only defining the
                decision of the correct family, but even recognizing <i> "the hand of God" </i> and inviting the
                marchesina to consider the vocational research ended to learn how to take everyday life, the
                housekeeping commitments, the responsibility of accompanying the sister <b> Rosa </b> as a means
                that the Lord placed at his disposal for his own sanctification. <br>
                The constant invitation to <b> Magdalene </b> from her spiritual father was the unconditional abandonment to
                God only that he was a loving father, but the will of the Marquis was still, understandably,
                fluctuating and the temptation to withdraw into itself in the search for one had not entirely disappeared <i>
                definitive arrangement for one's own life "</i>, had not definitively emerged <i>" from a situation of intimism,
                of spiritual solipsism believed to be a vocation from on high ". </i>
                Meanwhile <b> Magdalene </b>, overburdened by the responsibilities of managing the house, was assaulted by
                guilt because he could not dedicate, in his opinion, sufficient time to prayer and to the service of charity
                who had started with <b> Sacred Brotherhood of the Preti and Laici Spedalieri </b> of <b> don Leonardi </b>, but his guide urged her to offer everything to God with love. </p>
				<p> Concerns about the conflict about the inheritance between Brother <b> Bonifacio and Uncle Gerolamo </b>, the distress
                for the failed marriage of <b> Rosa </b>, the complex political situation that forced <b> Magdalene </b>, in May
                of 1796, to flee, with his family, to Venice, where he remained until October of the following year,
                they were, according to <b> don Libera </b>, the inscrutable ways of God who wanted to lead the marquisine to <i> "live in the
                half a century with barefooted heart ". </i>
                In August 1797, in exile in Venice, he was born <b> Carlino </b>, son of the <b> marquise Claudia Buri </b> and of the <b> uncle
                Gerolamo </b>, on November 2 of the same year the wife of the uncle, after having entrusted his son to <b> Magdalene </b>,
                because he took care of it, he died. <br>
                <b> Don Libera </b> wrote to her: <i> "And who does not see in all the order of things and in all the vicissitudes of his house that
                She certainly can more cooperate with the glory of the Lord in the family than if she were locked up in a cloister.
                I see my daughter the weight that comes to them; but that God who imposes it will still give us the help of
                take "</i>. <br>
                According to <b> De Battisti </b> <i> "Magdalene at the bedside of her dying aunt had a bright light on
                conformity to the will of God "</i>, at his glance <i>" the facts of life ceased to be "cases" to assume
                more and more the aspect of providential events "</i>. <br>
                Having become <b> adoptive mother of Carlino </b> definitely placed in check, at least at the present time,
                his personal aspirations towards an eventual consecration: he had only to continue, on the advice of his director,
                the negotiations, probably begun in 1795, <i> "for a foundation of Scalze nuns in his city" </i>. </p>
                <p> Meanwhile, in 1798, <b> Rosa </b> married the <b> Count Girolamo Orti of Verona </b>, and the following year <b> Eleonora </b>
                he married the <b> marquis Federico Serègo </b>. <br>
				Finally, between June and July of 1799, <b> Magdalene </b> reached the <i> "conclusion of the negotiation, but
                finding himself restless, he expressed the other thought to the Director "</i>, his dream: <i>" <b> to save girls from the street,
                Assisting Nurses in Hospitals, Setting Up Schools to Train Nurses, Implementing the Union of Hospitals </b> "</i>. <br>
                <b> Don Libera </b> urged her to immediately, without hesitation, cut off negotiations for the foundation and
                to pursue, with <i> "holy indifference of the outcome, depending only on God" </i>, the aforementioned plan,
                subjecting him to the vicar general of the diocese who, in turn, wanted to be presented to the <b>bishop
                Avogadro </b>, which <i> "opposed visits to hospitals, and insinuated the schools of Charity" </i> <b> advising
                Magdalene to work with Don Leonardi </b>. <br>
                Indeed <i> "Magdalene desisted from the interest of the hospital assistance organization" </i>, continuing
                his service as a lady in the hospital, was thanks to this service that met the <b> Countess Carolina Trotti Durini </b>
                which had arrived in Verona before November 1800 to get to know the work of the Brotherhood on the ground. </p>
                <p> The marquisine cultivated with this noble woman, who was busy with her husband and sister <i> "to succor the many poverties" </i>
                of Milan, a deep friendship moved by the desire of both to work to expand charity by giving back
                dignity to people through the love of Christ. <br>
                In July 1799 he molded what would become the school of charity offering shelter to two girls
                abandoned, but on January 22, 1800, at the age of 62, after witnessing the birth of <b> Magdalene's dream </b>, she died
                suddenly, for apoplexy, <b> don Luigi Libera </b>. <br>
                A <b> Magdalene </b> only the council of the vicar general remained as the will of God
                to turn for spiritual discernment to <b> don Nicola Galvani </b>. </p>

			<h3> 4. Magdalene the founder </h3>
            <p> In March 1801 the "shelter" for girls found a house opposite the Church of the Filipinos, in
            meanwhile it was necessary to devise something that would allow the maintenance of the service. <br>
            <b> Magdalene </b> created <b> the Three Money Company </b>, a group of people who pledged to give,
            every week, three money for the sustenance of the eight girls followed by <b> Metilde Bunioli </b> and <b> Metilde Giarola </b>. <br>
            Expired the lease in 1802 the shelter moved to Via Regaste, in the San Zeno district, and only in
            July 1803 Magdalene with Metilde Bunioli, Metilde Giarola and <b> Angela Traccagnini </b> started the
            free school outside. <br>
            On December 6, 1803, <b> Bonifacio </b> got married and the following year, after the death of <b> great-uncle Francesco Borgia </b>, the
            <b> Uncle Gerolamo </b> decided to entrust <b> Carlino </b> to a preceptor. <br>
            <b> Magdalene was finally free from the duties of the home administration </b>, she could have gone to
            live in Regaste street, but the family did not think the accommodation was decent and therefore had to wait until
            when he found a place suited to his status. <br>
            This happened in 1806, when he began negotiations with the State Property for <b> the former monastery of the saints
            Giuseppe and Fidenzio of the Augustinian nuns </b>, in the district of San Zeno, which he obtained in 1808. The family
            he could no longer place any obstacle to the desire of <b> Magdalene </b> to go and live in San Zeno with a dozen
            of girls, the three most faithful collaborators and the new addition <b> Domenica Faccioli </b>. <br>
            With them, conducted by the <b> Can. Pacetti </b> who will become the director of the Opera (taking care to act as an intermediary
            with the ecclesial authorities), there was also a small group of religious led by <b> Leopoldina Naudet </b> and <b> Magdalene </b>,
            considering himself unable to offer valid guidelines for his companions, he appointed superior of the house, <b> Leopoldina </b> considered fundamental
            the enclosure and education of the upper class, while <b> Magdalene </b> desired an Institute, without enclosure, which
            the poorest were needed. <br>
            The cohabitation between the two groups was not always easy, as evidenced by <b> <i> the Memories and the Epistolary </i> </b>, also because
			objectively <b> Magdalene </b>, with her collaborators, and <b> Leopoldina </b>, with her
            religious, had two different charisms, so much that their streets separated in 1816. </p>
            <p> In 1810 and later in 1812 <b> Magdalene </b> was first called to Venice to help the brothers
            <b> Cavanis </b> in the educational work aimed at girls, later to export, at the request of <b> don Lorenzo
            Piazza </b>, the experience that she had developed in Verona, here <b> Magdalene </b> started to
            provide not only for the school of charity and for catechetical formation, but also for spiritual assistance to the
            ills. </p>
            <p> Magdalene's story continued in: <br>
            - the various foundations, in 1816 in Milan, in 1820 in Bergamo, in 1828 in Trento; <br>
            - the need to communicate to the sisters, through a <b> Rule of Life </b> (which began to write probably
            between 1811 and 1812 in Venice), how to correspond to the gift that God had given them, calling them
            in the <b> Institute of the Daughters of Charity and Servants of the Poor </b>; <br>
            - animation of residential seminars for the preparation of country teachers; <br>
            - organization of spiritual exercises for ladies and tertiaries; <br>
            - the need to obtain recognition from the ecclesial authorities first in the various dioceses then, seen
            the amplitude that the Institute was assuming, also by the <b> Supreme Pontiff </b>, as it later
            1828 with the approval of the Rule by <b> Leo XII </b>; <br>
            - the repeated attempts to give life to the male branch, which began only in 1831; </p>
            <p> On April 10, 1835, the foundress of the Daughters and Sons of Charity died in Verona. </p>
