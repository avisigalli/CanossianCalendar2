                        <p> I understood that those who engage themselves in pre-

their sufferings. It was a sentiment infused by God and
because of it there awakened in me the usual feeling of
love.

the Lord, confiding to him that I felt like dying. I tried to
distract my mind from what I could not possibly bear.

might have done; it was for no reason except his own
compassion that he saved us living water.
