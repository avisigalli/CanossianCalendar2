                        <p> Humility is like the safe which encloses and secures all
the other virtues. Let us ask it at every moment from the
Lord and Mary, Most Holy, who was chosen to be the
Mother of God on account of this virtue. Let us practise it
faithfully.
<b>Unabridged Rule 242</b></p>
                        <p class=bibbia> Shoulder my yoke and learn from me, for I am gentle and

my yoke is easy and my burden light.

                        <p>The first degree of Humility is self-knowledge, that is, to
acknowledge one's own nothingness, though the grace of

<b>Unabridged Rule 236</b> </p>

<b>Unabridged Rule 239</b></p>

                        <p> Mutual understanding and universal affection without
distinction are recommended to all. If someone should
fail in charity towards another person, he/she must ask
forgiveness and be reconciled at least before going to
bed.
<b>Unabridged Rule 52</b></p>
                        <p class=bibbia> My prayer is that your love for each other may increase
more and more and never stop improving in knowledge
and the perception of what is best.

the most perfect charity. It would be monstruous to neneglect the observance of that Commandment and for
the fulfilment of which He wanted to die on the Cross.
<b>Unbridged Rule 51</b></p>
