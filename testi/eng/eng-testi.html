<p>A CALENDAR marks out TIME:<br>
    <b>CHRONOS</b> is logical and sequential time;<br>
    <b>KAIROS</b> is the right and favourable time, it is God's time;<br>
    a period of indefinite time in which "something" special happens.</p>

<p>While Chronos is quantitative, Kairos is of a qualitative nature.<br>
    In the history of salvation <b>God</b> freely thinks up a series of interventions which unfold in particular moments and these interventions are related to one another for the realization of a design.<br>
    <b>JESUS CHRIST</b>, the fullness of time, gives full meaning to the temporal, spatial and creatural dimension.<br>
    Revelation presents itself, thus, as the history of continual irruption of a concrete
    presence, <b>God</b>, in space and time so as to encounter real people from whom He wishes a free decision of love in order to carry out His design of love.</p>
<p>Biblical time is measured by <b>God's Word</b> and by the obedience of His people, where the
human creature expresses, in fullness, the faculty of a human being-who-decides.<br>
All Revelation rests on history, history in continual unfolding, but which has a long past and
it will be fulfilled in the future, the history of God's free and merciful interventions in the world
    and the human beings free response.</p>
<p>A Question: How did Jesus live time?<br>
<b>Jesus</b> gave His time to prayer.
<b>Jesus</b> gave His time to the poor, the sick and the suffering.
<b>Jesus</b> gave time to the Word, to the ministry of the Word.
<b>Jesus</b> gave much time to the formation of the Apostles.
<b>Jesus</b> gave much time to personal encounters of different types.
<b>Jesus</b> gave priority to the use of time.
<b>Jesus</b> had a clear vision of His mission.
<b>Jesus</b> had a precise knowledge of the use of time.
    <b>Jesus</b> took Himself away from His occupations so as to pray and to be with His apostles.</p>
<p><b>Magdalene of Canossa</b>:
"This situation is in God's hands; we must wait for the opportune moment of Divine Providence."<br>
"Now is the time to do what one can, until God removes these difficult circumstances."<br>
"Put yourself in the hands of the Lord who will make everything turn out for your good."<br>
"Abandon yourself in the Lord's hands because in His time, He will provide for everything."<br>
"Let us place ourselves in His hands, waiting for what He has planned for us."<br>
    "Time will settle everything."</p>
<p><b>Don Libera</b>:<br>
"How can you doubt that at the opportune time He will reveal His living designs?"<br>
    "We want to hope that God, at the opportune time, will grant our desires."</p>
<p>In my life it is important that Chronos must be on the same wavelength as Kairos
in contemplating the moment when God enters time
and permeates history and my existence
with His Mystery of Grace and
    Salvation. AMEN!</p>

the trial the one who is dear to God.
<b>Ecclesiasticus 2:4</b>

it not ordained that the Christ should suffer and so enter
into his glory? So Jesus said to them. 
<b>Luke 24:26</b>

Our Father, may Your Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven!
Farewell. It is useless for me to tell you to be patient be-

again, pray for me and, if it is God's will, pray so that in
winter we can move house.

ve, my dear Daughter, the road of patience is that which
sanctifies and the Lord will help you. I will always recom-

ything you do for his love.
<b><b>Letters III/4, 2455</b>
You will be hated by all on account of my name, but not a
hair of your head will be lost. Your endurance will win
you your lives.

Jesus, Meek and Humble
of Heart, Make us
Meek and Humble

In order to succeed in educating these girls, it is fitting to
study their character and temperament; it is necessary to
value the formation of the heart and this means using
greater gentleness with one, more forcefulness and rea-
soning with another. 
<b><b>Unabridged Rule 142</b>
I, myself, taught Ephraim to walk, I took him in my arms; I
led him with reins of kindness, with leading strings of lo-
ve.

red on the Cross with unconquerable patience, mee-
kness, sufferance and gentleness. He forgot Himself out

trust in the righteous judge.

it until it is subdued and not felt anymore, just like a sta-
tue. Thus internal mortification is needed.
<b><b>Unabridged Rule 266</b>
Never have grudges against others, or lose your temper.
Be friends with everyone, forgiving each other as readily
as God forgave you, in Christ.
<b>Ephesians 4:31-32</b>

As soon as I returned home I was surprised at a fault I
committed. I had become impatient in having to correct a
companion. I recomposed myself immediately by the
grace of divine mercy.

If one of you commits a fault, the more spiritual of you
who set him right should do so in a spirit of gentleness.

Jesus Crucified, the Greatest Love, Bless Our struggles!

During Holy Week, while reading in a meditation book
the verse "Inspice et Fac secundum exemplar", I experi-
enced an inner stirring, so strong that it remained with
me for several days. I felt urged to follow the Crucified
Christ but without understanding anything clearly.
<b> Memoirs  I, 32</b>
Have in you the same sentiments that were in Christ Je-
sus who did not cling jealously to His equality with God.
<b>Philippians 2:6</b>

Then, I found consolation only in prayer. One day Christ
Crucified showed Himself to me and I understood that I
had to be deprived of the sensible presence of God, to
which I did not know how to adapt myself.
<b> Memoirs  IV, 7</b>
"Take Him away and crucify Him."... "Do you want me to
crucify your king?" So they handed him over to be cruci-
fied. 
<b>John 19:15-16</b>

While I was in Church praying for the Institute, at the al-
tar of the Virgin, contemplating Christ Crucified, I had a
mental picture of a plain cross and I had an inner under-
standing that I had to prepare myself for the cross, a
cross for me.
<b> Memoirs  IV, 40</b>
As they were leading him away, they seized Simon from
Cyrene and made him shoulder the cross to carry it
behind him.
<b>Luke 23:26 </b>

The text, "Torcular calcavi solus et de gente mea unus
non est mecum" ("I have trodden the winepress alone.
No one of the people was with me." Is 63:3) came up be-
fore me, whether it was through my imagination or in the
usual way, I do not know.
<b> Memoirs  V, 15</b>
Pilate had Jesus taken away and scourged; and after, the
soldiers twisted some thorns into a crown and put it on
his head.
<b>John 19:1-2</b>

At other times, without seeing anything with my bodily
eyes nor with any strong interior impulse, the Crucified
Christ was often shown to me as He really is, stripped of
everything.
<b> Memoirs  V, 19</b>
Judas, one of the Twelve, went up to Jesus to kiss Him.
Jesus said, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with
a kiss?" 
<b>Luke 22:47-48</b>

Finding myself shaken by fear that some foreseen pro-
blems could cause our Work to collapse, the Lord made
quite clear to me that a work, beset by tribulation, is the
greatest proof that it belongs to Him. 
<b> Memoirs  VI, 15</b>
I consider all these advantages as disadvantages and I be-
lieve nothing can happen that will outweigh the supreme
advantage of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord.
<b>Philippians 3:7</b>

The moment approached when God thought fit to visit
me with a cross. Given my weakness, it did not appear
small. While I was praying before the Blessed Sacrament,
suddenly I saw Jesus Christ Crucified covered with
wounds.
<b> Memoirs  VIII, 3</b>
At the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "My
God, my God, why have you deserted me?" Jesus gave a
loud cry and breathed His last.
<b>Mark 15:33-37 </b>

I did not have any physical strength to unite myself inte-
riorly to the Lord so I abandoned my soul into God's
hands that He might do with it whatever He pleased; I
then remained very recollected.
<b> Memoirs  VIII, 23</b>
Come to me, all you who labour and are overburdened,
and I will give you rest, and you will find rest for your
souls.
<b>Matthew 11:28</b>

Towards the end of my prayer, I think I saw a short cross
planted in the midst of my soul and it was very heavy.
Since I naturally shrink from suffering, I tried to distract
myself from these thoughts.
<b> Memoirs  XII, 32-33</b>
In you, O Lord, I take shelter; never let me be disgraced.
In your justice deliver me, rescue me, turn your ear to
me, make haste!
<b>Psalm 31:1</b>

While praying, I could perceive God's essence in my inner
self. I felt as though the soul was being transported, with
great peace and sweetness, to unite itself with God and
be immersed in Him.
<b> Memoirs  XII, 30</b>
Play music in the Lord's honour, you his faithful ones, re-
member His holiness. His anger lasts a moment, His
favour a lifetime.
<b>Psalm 30:5-6</b>

I made a sincere act of contrition and even made myself
available, if possible, to be reduced to atoms of dust, just
to see God glorified and I was also prepared to suffer the
pains of hell, provided no one entered there.
<b> Memoirs  XII, 43</b>
I have never kept your righteousness to myself, but have
spoken of your faithfulness, love and truth in the great
assembly.
<b>Psalm 40:10 </b>

My imagination was illumined with a vision of Jesus car-
rying the cross on His shoulders, crowned with thorns,
and He said, "I too, was weak when I carried the cross."
<p><b>Memoirs  XIII, 42</p>
And yet ours were the sufferings He bore. He was pierced
through for our faults, crushed for our sins.
<b>Isaiah 53:4</b>

I cannot remember if I had offered myself to carry the
cross for Him or if the Divine Redeemer presented Him-
self before me. I saw Him without the cross throwing
Himself into my arms; I saw Him in my imagination.
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 60</b>
Harshly dealt with, He bore it humbly; like a lamb that is
led to the slaughter-house, for our faults struck down in
death.
<b>Isaiah 53:7</b>

I imagined a great suffering and the remembrance of that
experience helped me, that is, the immense suffering of
our Redeemer and the heaviness of His cross, thus I did
not find the cross as heavy as I expected.
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 52.56</b>
On Him lies a punishment that brings us peace, and
through His wounds we are healed.
<b>Isaiah 53:5</b>

But the spiritual experience had been so strong that even
though I had to deal with matters and engage in conver-
sation, everything led me back to God. On that day I felt
greatly rewarded for the little I had suffered for His Work.
<b> Memoirs  III, 35.37</b>
May you grasp the breadth and the length, the height
and the depth until you know the love of Christ.
<b>Ephesians 3:18 </b>

I remained recollected and closely united to Him for the
duration of a Mass. I was consoled to see Him without
the cross and crown of thorns, and I was only too ready
to carry the cross if this should lighten His suffering. I too,
was relieved and at peace.
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 61</b>
It makes me happy to suffer for you. I complete in my bo-
dily suffering what is lacking to the sufferings of Christ,
for the sake of His body, the Church.
<b>Colossians 1:24</b>

In this state of spoliation of everything, one evening, I lif-
ted my eyes and I saw the Crucified Jesus in the act of
expiring. I lowered my eyes, but on raising them for the
second time, there I saw Him again. 
<b> Memoirs  XV, 22.23</b>
A darkness came over the whole land. Jesus cried out in a
loud voice and said: "Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit." And He breathed His last.
<b>Luke 23:44-46</b>

On that occasion I saw the Lord; He was motionless, with
a cross so big that one could not see the end of it. As a
result my strength increased and I was no longer afraid of
suffering, of which I am never deprived. 
<b> Memoirs  XV, 44</b>
By force and by law He was taken; He was torn away from
the land of the living and for our faults He was struck
down in death.
<b>Isaiah 53:8</b>

I decided that, in considering the passion, the Tertiaries
should reflect on the excessive charity of Jesus Christ and
pray to be able to bear, with love, bitterness, forgetful-
ness and wrongs. 
<b> Memoirs  XV, 63</b>
Live according to the Christ you have received; you must
be rooted in Him and built on Him and held firm by the
faith you have been taught.
<b>Colossians 2:6 </b>

I cannot recall in detail the spiritual experiences of that
day, but my love increased and became stronger ... I was
left with a consuming desire to work for the Lord and se-
ek Him alone. 
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 13</b>
Set me like a seal on your heart, like a seal on your arm.
For love is strong as death, jealously relentless as Sheol.
<b>Song of Songs 8:6</b>

On Good Friday, I was so deeply penetrated by the suffe-
ring of Christ that I could not do anything but weep. I
tried very hard not to let my companions notice it.
<b> Memoirs  XII, 15</b>
Large numbers of people followed Him and of women
too, who mourned and lamented for Him: "... do not
weep for me ..."
<b>Luke 23:27</b>

I was left with a consuming desire to work for the Lord
and to seek nothing else but Him alone. Because of my
weakness I always commit some imperfections when de-
aling with those with whom I live, even though they are
holy. 
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 13</b>
Why are you so down cast, my soul? Put your hope in
God: I shall praise Him yet, my saviour, my God.
<b>Psalm 42:12</b>

I thought I would die of love, and there was nothing I
could think of except Jesus Christ. As far as I can remem-
ber, my Easter day was a day of joy which, however, was
not proportioned to the sorrow.
<b> Memoirs  XII, 20</b>
I remember and my soul melts within me: I am on my
way to the wonderful Tent, to the house of God, among
cries of joy and an exultant throng.
<b>Psalm 42:4 </b>

It means animating all our actions and work with the Spi-
rit of Jesus Christ, a spirit of charity, gentleness, mee-
kness and humility, a spirit of zeal and fortitude, a most
amiable, most generous and most patient spirit.
<b><b>Unabridged Rule, 19</b>
As children of His that He loves, try to imitate Jesus: live
in love, taking Christ as your example, who loved us till
the end.
<b>Ephesians 5:1</b>

It involves more: to fulfill the two precepts by reprodu-
cing as far as is granted to us, poor creatures, the holy life
of Our Lord Jesus Christ, imitating him in interior and
exterior virtues, leading a life totally engaged in seeking
the Divine Glory. 
<b><b>Unabridged Rule, 18</b>
You must always think what is best for you and for ever-
yone; be happy at all times, pray constantly and for all
things give thanks to God.
<b>1 Thessalonians 5:16</b>

One who is not burning with zeal herself cannot set o-
thers aflame; what kind of fire do we need in order to
train, educate, console and talk to our neighbour in the
Works of Charity? Do not be frightened at seeing the
greatness of the aim proposed. 
<b><b>Unabridged Rule, 18</b>
I have come to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it
were blazing already! There is a baptism I must receice...
<b>Luke 12:49</b>

I offered myself with all my heart and affection to the
Lord to do His Will in everything. I had the impression of
being here in transit, as I am at present.

Then I said, "Here I am, I'm coming! In the scroll of the
book it is written that I should obey your will. I have al-
ways loved your law.
<b>Psalm 40:8 </b>

During prayer, it seemed to me that my soul was again
drawn into God's presence, not in the form of Sun, but as
Spirit. I was struck by His greatness, goodness and other
attributes, but especially the first of these.
<b> Memoirs  XI, 6-7</b>
Love no flood can quench, no torrents drown. The flash
of it is a flash of fire, a flame of God Himself.
<b>Song of Songs 8:7</b>

The intensity of my feelings was so great, I think I was re-
ally sincere at the time, that I offered myself to the Lord
to suffer in whatever way and for any length of time He
might want and even to bear alone the pains of hell.
<b> Memoirs  IX, 26</b>
Happy those who live in your house and can praise you
all day long; and happy the pilgrims inspired by you with
courage to make the Ascents!
<b>Psalm 84:6</b>

The infinite mercy of the Lord has always assisted me
even when I had not really done anything good. Thus I
remained ready to suffer, even to the point of expecting
suffering, but with joy and peace. 
<b> Memoirs  VII, 50-51</b>
I love you Lord, my strength, my salvation, my rock, my
shield, my deliverer, my God and I take shelter in Him.
<b>Psalm 18:3</b>

Mary, Mother of Charity,
Help Us to Live the
Greatest Love!
I began to honour the Most Holy Virgin under the title of
the "Sorrowful Virgin". In fact, since I was a child I always
had a great love and devotion to Our Lady. I believe that
the devotion to Mary, under this title, was inspired by my
second companion.

Your eyes have seen my actions; in your book there are
all written; my days were limited before one of them esi-

Your ways, O Lord, make known to me: teach me your

heart and fulfil your every plan.

Let all who take refuge in You be glad and exult forever.

Your name.

When I call out to the Lord, He answers me from His holy
mountain.

ties that surround me. There was a time when all these
wotties seemed to get the better of me, but recourse to
Mary and felpe me to regain my peace.

God is our refuge and our strength, an ever-present help
in distress. Therefore we fear not, though the earth be
shaken and mountains plunge into the sea.

I understood that those engage themselves in preventing
sins, have already consoled Jesus and Mary in their suffe-
rings. I accepted to endure any kind of suffering.
<b> Memoirs  XV, 72</b>
I am very much afflicted, O Lord, give me life according
to your word. Accept, O Lord, the free homage of my
mouth and teach me your decrees.
<b>Psalm 119:107</b>

I felt that if I really sought God alone and the most Holy
Virgin, in the way the Lord wanted, I could always count
on their help in this life and they would not abandon me
at the hour of death.
<b> Memoirs  V, 10</b>
The Lord will you from all evil, He will guard your life. The
Lord will guard your coming and your going both now
and forever.

of, the move took place. We had purposely chosen a
Saturday for this.

Send forth your light and your fidelity; they shall lead me
on and bring me to your holy mountain, to your dwelling
place.
<b>Psalm 43:3</b>

The only moment of tranquility I enjoyed was when I
went to visit the Shrine of Our Lady in St. Celsus but it
was not to last long. The fact that I had to dwell among
the upper class might have contributed.

I call out with all my heart: answer me, O Lord; I will ob-

promised him not to do it anymore though I am still as-
sailed by some doubts.

ineffable joy in me at the thought of my encounter with
Him and with the Blessed Virgin.

Bless the Lord you servants who do His will.
Bless the Lord all you creatures. Bless the Lord my soul.

<!-- giugno -->

Jesus, the Greatest Love,
Make us Docile Instruments
For Your Kingdom!
I found myself united to God so intensely, with a feeling
of love so strong that I was almost unaware of what was
happening around me.
<b> Memoirs  II, 40</b>
We have known and put our faith in God's love towards
ourselves. God is love and anyone who lives in love lives
in God and God lives in him.
<b>1 John 4:16</b>

Once again, and perhaps more than ever, I began to feel
myself closely united with God: that feeling of love con-
tinued to grow in me, although in my opinion, it was not
possible to increase any further.
 <b> Memoirs  III, 7</b>
Love the Lord, all you devout: the Lord protects the faith-
ful. Be strong, let your heart be bold, all you who hope in
the Lord.
<b>Psalm 31: 24</b>

I felt in a special way, on the one hand, the power of the
Lord drawing my soul to unite itself with Him and on the
other, His amiability and the force of His love against the
inability of my spirit imprisoned in the body.
<b> Memoirs  III, 22</b>
God's love for us was revealed when God sent into the
world His only Son so that we could have life through
Him.
<b>1 John 4: 9 </b>

A great desire came upon me for Heaven where that
union, which is not possible to realise on earth, would be
perfected. It seemed as though my very soul was attem-
pting every way to leave the prison of the body.
<b> Memoirs  III, 23</b>
This is the love I mean: not our love for God, but God's
love for us when He sent His Son for our salvation.
<b>1 John 4: 10</b>

At another time, while I was again at prayer before the
Blessed Sacrament, I experienced one of those usual fee-
lings, I had the vision of the splendour of Heaven; God
Himself and our condition as pilgrims were being shown
to me. 
<b> Memoirs  III, 26</b>
We are to love, then, because He loved us first. Anyone
who loves God must also love his brother.
<b>1 John 4: 19,21</b>

During prayer, I was overcome by a surge of love towards
God, so strong that the soul, being imprisoned in the bo-
dy, was prevented from uniting itself with Him and would
have tried to release itself.
<b> Memoirs  III, 40</b>
My beloved went down to his garden, to the beds of spi-
ces. I am my Bleloved's, and my Beloved is mine. He pa-
stures his flock among the lilies. 
<b>Song od Songs 6: 2</b>

I was overcome by a surge of love towards God ... within
me it seemed as if the soul was trying to flee from the
body like a little bird, to explain it better, as though at-
tempting to flee from the cage. 
<b> Memoirs  III, 43</b>
O Lord, I mean to thank you among the peoples, your lo-
ve is high as heaven, your faithfulness as the clouds.
<b>Psalm 108: 4-5 </b>

This view of Christ's love for men not only grieved me,
for I saw that He is not loved, but it also gave me a great
longing to make Him known and loved; so much so that
nothing else mattered.
<b> Memoirs  III, 49</b>
This is what loving God is: keeping His commandments;
and His commandments are not difficult. 
<b>1 John 5: 3</b>

Nothing else mattered, not even my country nor my rela-
tives. I wished I could be reduced to dust if, in that way, I
could be scattered to all parts of the world so that God
would be known and loved. 
<b> Memoirs  III, 50</b>
My dear people, let us love one another since love
comes from God and everyone who loves is begotten by
God and knows God. 
<b>1 John 4: 7</b>

While assisting at Holy Mass, at the moment of Holy
Communion, as soon as I had received the sacred Host, I
found myself charged with strong feelings of love to-
wards God and was moved to unite myself spiritually to
Him. 
<b> Memoirs  IV, 11</b>
If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God,
God lives in him and he in God. 
<b>1 John 4: 15</b>

However, the effects of the calm remained, the recollec-
tion, the desire to seek God alone and to ensure that He
be loved and that He be served by all.
<b> Memoirs  IV, 15</b>
As a doe longs for running streams, so my soul longs for
you, my God. My soul thirsts for God, the God of life.
<b>Psalm 42: 2-3</b>

In the brief moments in which I found myself united with
the Lord, I was strengthened in my resolution to suffer. It
seemed to me then that God wanted me to practise in
faith, Alone with God alone, which I already greatly de-
sired. 
<b> Memoirs  VI, 11</b>
But I, so great is your love, may come to your house, and
before your Holy Temple bow down in reverence to you.
<b>Psalm 5: 8</b>

Once, feeling myself strongly united to God in prayer, I
felt an irresistible urge to cast myself into the Heart of Je-
sus and this is what I actually did. It seemed as though I
had been immersed more deeply into God than I had
ever experienced in the past. 
<b> Memoirs  VI, 16</b>
Israel, I will betroth you to myself forever, betroth you
with integrity and justice, with tenderness and love; I will
betroth you to myself with faithfulness. 
<b>Hosea 2: 21</b>

These experiences left me a very special desire to pre-
vent offence to the Lord, I also felt a deep sorrow for any
fault which I might have commited. There was a fear
prompted by love, of offending Him again but I felt an ar-
dent desire for Heaven.
<b> Memoirs  VI, 55</b>
O God, I am seeking you, my soul is thirsting for you, my
flesh is longing for you, a land parched, weary and water-
less. 
<b>Psalm 63: 2</b>

Even after I have displeased the Lord with trifles, as I of-
ten do, I am filled with a great tenderness of affection,
conscious of the fact that He alone is the only object of
my love and thus I am prepared for anything ... as any
kind of sacrifice is naught to me. 
<b> Memoirs  VII, 31</b>
O God, your love is better than life itself, my lips will reci-
te your praise; all my life I will bless you, on my lips a
song of joy. 
<b>Psalm 63: 4-6</b>

What I longed for was only to suffer, even though I still
have a fear for it. I believe that when I desire it, it may
not be for God's service only but more for the desire of
the delight that comes from finding myself united to Him.
<b> Memoirs  VII, 54</b>
O God, come and rescue me. To me, poor wretch, come
quickly, God! My helper, my saviour, O Lord, come wi-
thout delay!
<b>Psalm 70: 6</b>

I also experienced a heavenly peace and such a deep ye-
arning to be in Paradice, that I even wished to be struck
by lightening, in order to die ... each cross appeared to be
no more significant than a straw.
<b> Memoirs  VI, 17</b>
O Lord, my encircling shield, my glory, You help me hold
up my head. Loudly I cry to the Lord, and He answers me
from His holy mountain. 
<b>Psalm 3: 3-4</b>

On returning to Verona, awaiting me were many crosses
related to my duties. One day, as I was praying, I expe-
rienced one of my usual transports of love. It was from
here that I drew the strength to overcome every diffi-
culty.
<b> Memoirs  VIII, 10</b>
Happy the pilgrims inspired by you, O Lord, God of all
creation, with courage to make their way from height to
height towards Zion.
<b>Psalm 84: 7</b>

I came to understand the exquisite charity of the Heart of
the Lord and afflicted after so many proof of love, on the
spur of the moment I replied: "If then I am so ungrateful,
which is true, will I be saved!" 
<b> Memoirs  VIII, 17</b>
I thank you with all my heart, Lord my God, I glorify your
name forever, your love for me has been so great, You ha-
ve rescued me from the depths of Sheol.
<b>Psalm 86: 12-13</b>

It seems to me that I love the Lord with great tenderness.
In spite of the fact that I love Him with all my heart, when
it comes to reality, my actions are inconsistent, neither
do I practise humility nor am I strong in suffering.
<b> Memoirs  VIII, 25</b>
Lord God, you who are always merciful and always tender
hearted, slow to anger, always loving, always loyal. Give
me your strength.
<b>Psalm 86: 15</b>

There is only one thing I perceive, for both my interior
and exterior life. It seems to me I have reached the point
where God has so many times indicated that He wants
me: alone, with Him alone. 
<b> Memoirs  IX, 34</b>
I will celebrate your love forever, O Lord, age after age my
words will proclaim your faithfulness; for I claim that love
is built to last forever.
<b>Psalm 89: 1-2</b>

God presented Himself to me not in the mind but in the
usual way as it happens in prayer, that is, as in Heaven.
Wherever I turned, wherever I looked I would find noth-
ing but God. 
<b> Memoirs  XI, 27-28</b>
I give always thanks to your name, O Lord, for your love
and faithfulness; your promise is even greater than your
fame.
<b>Psalm 138:2</b>

It is obvious to me that I am again called to seek GOD
ALONE, despite my ingratitude and infidelity. I became
very distressed about some matters. Humanly speaking,
there was some justified motives for this.
 <b> Memoirs  XI, 31</b>
My song is about kindness and justice; O Lord, I sing to
You. I mean to make good progress, as the blameless do:
when will You come to me?
<b>Psalm 101: 1-2</b>

I had given myself to God and it seemed that my heart
was not mine to dispose of. It was perhaps that morning
during prayer that this thought came to me. Since I can-
not any longer love Him myself, I would love Jesus with
the heart of Jesus. 
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 10</b>
I am my Beloved's, and his desire is for me ... the rarest
fruits I have stored them for you, my Beloved.
<b>Song of Songs 7: 14</b>

My love increased and gathered strength as I was
prompted to call Him "My dear Spouse". Another time, in
prayer, I thought I heard Him call me "My dear spouse"
but I might have imagined it.
 <b> Memoirs  XIII, 12</b>
I will betroth you to myself with faithfulness, and you will
come to know the Lord. When that day comes, the Lord
will bless His people. 
<b>Hosea 2: 22</b>

I was comforted by alternating thoughts of Heaven and
the brevity of life and what joy for me it was in the eve-
ning to realise that another day had gone, as long as I
had lived it well!
<b> Memoirs  VI, 12</b>
I exult for joy in the Lord, my soul rejoices in my God, for
He has clothed me in the garments of salvation, He has
wrapped me in the cloak of integrity. 
<b>Isaiah 61: 10</b>

I do not remember whether it was in the usual manner or
because of a meditation, though I believe it was the for-
mer, I was illuminated on the infinite love of Jesus in the
institution of the Blessed Sacrament. 
<b> Memoirs  XV, 62</b>
You prepare a table before me under the eyes of my ene-
mies and you anoint my head with oil. Goodness and
kindness pursue me every day of my life. 
<b>Psalm 23: 5-6</b>

I felt a sentiment infused by God and because of it, there
awakened in me the usual feeling of love. With great sin-
cerity, affection and with readiness of heart, I accepted to
endure any kind of suffering, in fact, I almost desired it.
<b> Memoirs  XV, 73</b>
It is the Lord, God of Israel, who is speaking, "I am going
to lure her and lead her out into the wilderness and
speak to her heart". 
<b>Hosea 2: 16</b>

Whenever I read something about the love of God I felt
great tenderness in my heart. One day, after Communion,
I was so closely united to God that I thought that nothing
could separate me from Him.
<b> Memoirs  X, 51</b>
Who will separate us from Christ's love? Perhaps trials,
worries, persecution ... trials through which we triumph,
by the power of Him who loved us.
<b>Romans 8: 35</b>

He made me understand that He wanted to be for me the
Absolute One and that I should not rely on anybody else
but to seek Him alone, loving and wanting no other but
Him.
<b> Memoirs  IX, 10</b>
"I hear my Beloved, see how He comes! Come then, my
love, my lovely one, come." "l sought Him whom my
heart loves."

Jesus, by Your Passion,
Cross and Resurrection,
Save us!
In my imagination I saw Our Lord carrying the cross on
His shoulders. He was crowned with thorns, and I ob-
served in particular what seemed like a gush of blood be-
low His chin, at the level of His neck.
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 49</b>
Drink all of you from this, for this is my blood, the blood
of the New Covenant, which is to be poured out for many
for the forgiveness of sin. 
<b>Matthew 26:28</b>

Guiding the Spiritual Exercises I felt urged to suggest a
meditation on Jesus carrying the cross to Calvary. While I
was helping them to reflect on the generosity of Jesus ...
suddenly my imagination was illumined ...
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 41-42</b>
Christ entered the sanctuary once and for all, taking with
Him not the blood of goats, but His own blood, having
won an eternal redemption for us.
<b>Hebrews 9:12</b>

I was profoundly impressed by the immense suffering of
our Redeemer and by the heaviness of the cross He was
carrying. That vision encouraged me and I imagined that I
would find great sufferings there. 
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 52-55</b>
In the Eucharist Jesus does not give us a "thing," but him-
self; He offers his body and pours out his blood. He thus
gives us the totality of his life and reveals the ultimate
origin of this love. 
<b>Sacramentum Caritatis 7</b>

I saw the extent of my ingratitude towards the Divine
Mercy. The Divine Redeemer was represented to me
without the cross or crown of thorns, but lacerated with
wounds and blood-spattered.
<b> Memoirs  XIII, 66</b>
Jesus Christ came by water and blood, not with water
only, but with water and blood.

it seemed that He threw Himself into my arms and that
His blood stuck to my person.

Taking part in the liturgy and receiving the Body and
Blood of Christ intensifies and deepens our belonging to
the One who died for us.
<b>Sacramentum Caritatis 76</b>

It was the fruit of the imagination to see the Divine Re-
deemer in the winepress. The only difference was that
the wounds around His neck were very fresh, very painful
and bleeding. 
<b> Memoirs   XIV, 11-12</b>
For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. He
who always eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me
and I live in him. 
<b>John 6:55-56</b>

What price, so loving, could Jesus pay for the ransom of
humanity by His Most Precious Blood, poured out with
such a generous heart and love so strong and tenacious.
<b>Riflessi Spirituali n. 4</b>
Remember the ransom that was paid to free you from
the useless way of life inherited from your fathers, with
the precious blood of Christ, the Lamb without stain.
<b>1 Peter 1:18-19 </b>
 
Sweet Jesus ... clothed in our human nature, having ap-
peared on earth, you wanted to be like all of us, a sinner,
and shed your Most Precious Blood in your Circumcision.
<b>Letters II/1, 77</b>

cumcised, they gave him the name Jesus, the name the
angel had given Him.

cious Blood and destroyed pride in the human heart, the
root of every sin.
<b>Letters II 178</b>
Then they stripped him and made him wear a scarlet
cloak and, having twisted some thorns into a crown, they
put this on his head. 
<b>Matthew 27:28-29  </b>

My Loving Jesus, unjustly condemned to death and bur-
dened with the heavy wood of the Cross, you shed your
Most Precious Blood along the roads of Jerusalem and
Calvary, may all people be converted and be saved.
<b>Rules and Spiritual writings II, 179</b>
They took charge of Jesus, and carrying his own Cross he
went out of the city to the place of the Skull, or as it was
called in Hebrew, Golgotha.

Wounds.

his side with a lance and immediately there came out
blood and water.
<b>John 19:34</b>

For the Congregation of the Sons of Charity, I desire that
it may be born on Calvary between Jesus Crucified and
Our Sorrowful Mother and grow with the Divine Blood
and the tears of Mary. May it burn and be inflamed by
charity. 
<b>Letters II/2, 801</b>
While the Blood of Christ reveals the greatness of the Fa-
ther's love, it shows how precious a person is in the eyes
of God.
<b>Evangelium Vitae, 25</b>

Since the Tertiaries belong to an Institute totally dedi-
cated to charity, it seems useless to recommend charity
because they are daughters of this virtue and profess it
through a devotion to the Precious Blood of that God
who is Charity itself. 
<b>Rules and Spiritual writings II, 33</b>
Contemplating Christ means recognising Him wherever
He manifests Himself, but above all, in the living Sacra-
ment of His Body and Blood. 
<b>Ecclesia de Eucaristia, 6</b>

Tell her, in my name, the true convent of the Daughters
of Charity is the Side of Jesus Christ. Continue to pray to
the Lord for strength since there is little hope.
<b>Letters III/4, 2555</b>
Jesus said to Thomas: "Put your finger here; look, here
are my hands. Give me your hand; put it into my side."
<b>John 20:27</b>

While I was praying before the Blessed Sacrament I saw
Jesus Crucified covered with wounds and blood. When I
was faced with the actual cross, sent to me by the Lord, I
understood very well the significance of that vision.
<b> Memoirs   VIII, 4-5</b>
I have been crucified with Christ, and I live no longer but
Christ lives in me ... He who loved me sacrificed himself
for my sake. 
<b>Galatians 2:20</b>

I was in Church before the Blessed Sacrament exposed, I
was again filled with love. All suffering seemed to vanish
and it dawned on me that when God's service is at stake,
nothing should become a hardship. 
<b> Memoirs   XI, 54</b>
Man is worth so much to God that He himself became
man so as to suffer with man in an utterly real way, in
flesh and blood, as revealed in Jesus' Passion. 
<b>Spes salvi, 39  </b>

Every time I was in pain and suffering I seemed to hear
those words: "I too ...". With this interior prompting, it
seemed to me everything was of scarce or no value at all
and I desired to remain strong in my suffering and work.
<b> Memoirs   XIII, 44-45</b>
When we communicate with the Body and Blood of Jesus
Christ, we take part in the Divine Life in an evermore
adult and conscious way.
<b>Sacramentum Caritatis, 70</b>

I prayed that the Tertiaries should be able to bear, with
love, the bitterness, insults, contempt, forgetfulness,
wrongs and anything else which the Lord deigns to send
them.
<b> Memoirs   XV, 63</b>
In the Eucharistic Sacrament, Jesus continues to love us
"until the end", leaving us His body and blood.
<b>Sacramentum Caritatis, 1</b>

I had a mental vision of Jesus Crucified. I could then
hardly grasp the depth of His sorrow on the cross, and I
was stirred to consume myself for Him.
<b> Memoirs   XV, 2-3</b>
The blood of Christ, who offered himself to God through
the eternal Spirit, can purify our inner self from dead ac-
tions so as to serve the living God.
<b>Hebrews 9:14</b>

I leaned mentally on the sacred humanity of Jesus Christ,
weighed down by my own cross and wondered if my suf-
fering could make the sufferings of Christ's passion any
lighter.
<b> Memoirs   XV, 71</b>
As an innocent lamb he merited life for us by his blood
which he freely shed. In him God reconciled us to himself
and to one another.
<b>Gaudium et Spes, 22 </b>
 
I think it was then that the Lord made me understand
that the more sins are committed, the more He suffered
in His Passion. At Holy Mass I offered myself to the Lord
in order to prevent sins.
<b> Memoirs   XV, 72</b>
In the Beloved, in whom, through His Blood, we gain our
freedom, the forgiveness of our sins, there is the richness
of His grace.
<b>Ephesians 1, 7</b>

While praying, I felt a little pacified concerning my sins.
After my vow, another fear took possession of me, the
fear that other souls would be lost. For such souls Christ
shed His blood. 
<b> Memoirs   XII, 47</b>
We cannot be content when we consider the millions of
our brothers and sisters who, like us, have been re-
deemed by the blood of Christ, but who live in ignorance
of the love of God.

Especially, during these years, I had such a strong desire
to prevent sins that ... I would have turned my blood into
gold if I could, thus facing death many a time.
<b> Memoirs   I, 30</b>
From the sacrifice of the Cross and communion with the
body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist, the Church
draws the spiritual power needed to carry out her mis-
sion . 
<b>Ecclesia de Eucharistia, 22</b>

As I prayed before the Blessed Sacrament, I was re-
minded of the agony of Jesus in the Garden of Olives. I
understood that the Tertiaries should start a reflection on
the Passion.

My Lord and My God,
May Whatever I do be
for Your Glory!

would reach it.

own, life included.

Our Lady of Sorrows,
Bring forth in Us
the Spirit of Jesus Crocified!
It was precisely at this time that I began to honour the

way. 
<b>Memoirs  II, 43</b>

<!-- novembre -->

Merciful Father,
Listen to our Plee:

sent moment.

They remained faithful to the teaching of the apostles, to

ercise.

In your prayers ... do not babble like the pagans do be-
cause they think that by using many words they will make
themselves heard.

There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one repen-
tant sinner that over ninety-nine virtuous men who have
no need of repentance.

soled me with His tender love.
<b>Memoirs  II, 4</b>
But to those who repent He permits return, and He en-
courages those who were losing hope.
<b>Ecclesiasticus 17: 24</b>

illuminated on the sins committed by humankind and the
offence God receives from such sins. I longed for mercy
for sinners but dared not ask for it seeing that the out-
raged one is God Himself. 
<b>Memoirs  IX, 42-43</b>
What proves that God loves us is that Christ died for us
while we were still sinners.

love.

Jesus was bearing our faults in his body on the cross, so
that we might die to our faults and live for holiness.

Jesus, Help Me to Live in Love and Humility, Today and Forever!

Jesus Christ was the universal mirrow of all the virtues,
but it was only of humility that He proposed Himself as
the Exemplar. Consequently, we must try in every way to
acquire and practice this Holy Virtue of Humility.
<b>Unabridged Rule 235</b>
Jesus emptied Himself to assume the condition of a slave
and became as men are; He was humbler yet.
<b>Philippians 2:7</b>

Humility is like the safe which encloses and secures all
the other virtues. Let us ask it at every moment from the
Lord and Mary, Most Holy, who was chosen to be the
Mother of God on account of this virtue. Let us practise it
faithfully.
<b>Unabridged Rule 242</b>
Shoulder my yoke and learn from me, for I am gentle and
humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls; yes,
my yoke is easy and my burden light.
<b>Matthew 11:29</b>

The first degree of Humility is self-knowledge, that is, to
acknowledge one's own nothingness, though the grace of
vocation is given gratuitously out of the liberality of the
Lord. We are only weak instruments . 
<b>Unabridged Rule 236</b>
Come to me, all you who labour and are overburdened:
and I will give you rest. Accept my Words and let me in-
struct you.
<b>Matthew 11:28</b>

God chooses the weak and powerless in order to con-
found the wise. The Lord, rightly wanting all the glory for
himself, is often pleased to choose for his work such in-
struments who do not attribute to themselves the suc-
cess of their works. 
<b>Unabridged Rule 236</b>
I bless You, Father, for hiding these things from the
learned and the clever and revealing them to mere chil-
dren.
<b>Matthew 11:26</b>

Let us always concentrate on our nothingness, in order to
oblige Him, who lifts the beggar from the ground and
raises the poor from the hovel, to use His gentle mercy
with our Institute.
<b>Unabridged Rule 237</b>
Those who trust in God are like Mount Sion, unshake-
able, standing forever. The Lord encircles His people now
and for always.
<b>Psalm 125:1</b>

In the practice of Holy Humility, in the second place it is
necessary to suffer patiently when others recognise us as
imperfect, incapable, ignorant, poor, weak and the Sisters
should bear patiently that the Institute be considered
lowly and worthless. 
<b>Unabridged Rule 237</b>
The Lord is great; I wish to praise Him. God is my Saviour;
I am full of joy. He has looked upon his lowly handmaid.
<b>Luke 1:46</b>

This takes us to the third degree of humility, as St. Francis
of Sales says, that they will bear cheerfully with it, since
we rejoice when others think the same way as we do.
<b>Unabridged Rule 238</b>
From this day forward all generations will call me blessed,
for the Almighty has done great things for me. Holy is His
name. 
<b>Luke 1:48</b>

The last degree: we try to be reputed and treated as
nothing. We must not speak of ourselves or our own
matters, either in good or in bad. We must even hide this
same search for humility with a special deftness in the
heart of humility itself. 
<b>Unabridged Rule 199</b>
His mercy reaches from age to age for those who love
him. He has shown the power of his arm, he has routed
the proud of heart.
<b>Luke 1:50</b>

Be fervent in external humiliations which do not consti-
tute Holy Humility, but they open the way and, little by
little, lead us to it. Let the Sisters refrain from speaking
about high-ranking origins, wealth or social status.
<b>Unabridged Rule 239</b>
He has pulled down princes from their thrones and ex-
alted the lowly. The hungry he has filled with good
things, the rich sent empty away.
<b>Luke 1:52</b>

Holy Humility does not lead to discouragement and delay
in the service of God, on the contrary, the special effect
of this virtue, when it is real, is to inspire the most lively
confidence in God who pours copious graces and bless-
ings on the humble. 
<b>Unabridged Rule 240</b>
He has come to the help of Israel his servant, mindfull of
his mercy, according to the promise he made to our an-
cestors, to Abraham and to his descendants. 
<b>Luke 1:54</b>

God resists the proud and pours copious graces and
blessings on the humble. The soul who knows how to
find everything in God is assured by his promises and
blessed with mercies.
<b>Unabridged Rule 201</b>
How happy are the poor in spirit; theirs is the Kingdom of
heaven. Happy the peacemakers; they shall be called the
sons of God. 
<b>Matthew 5:3. 9</b>

The humble soul, referring back every fruit of the gift to
the giver, commits herself to bless him more and more.
The Saints who worked most for their own sanctification
and for the Divine Glory were humble.
<b>Unabridged Rule 201</b>
The One who follows me is more powerful than I am, and
I am not fit to carry his sandals; he will baptise you with
the Holy Spirit and fire. 
<b>Matthew 3:11</b>

The Saints were very humble. We must imitate them and
ask the Lord unceasingly for this virtue, until God, who
gazes on the humble of the earth in order to bless them
and crown them in heaven, may deign to enroll all of us.
<b>Unabridged Rule 241</b>
Shrewdness is a fountain of life for its possessor. Kindly
words are a honeycomb, sweet to the taste, wholesome
to the body. 
<b>Proverbs 16:24</b>

Let us show Holy Humility even externally by a humble
bearing, modesty in look and in manner. In dealing with
the poor let us never forget that we are always their ser-
vants and we have always to bear any kind of rough and
uncivil treatment from them. 
<b>Unabridged Rule 241</b>
God, create a clean heart in me, put into me a new and
constant spirit. Be my Saviour again, renew my joy, keep
my spirit steady and willing.
<b>Psalm 50:12</b>

They are not to uphold their opinion too firmly when
their duty does not require it for the service of God or for
the good of their neighbour. They must always have a
great desire to progress daily in this holy virtue.
<b>Unabridged Rule 241</b>
Thus says the Lord: My eyes are drawn to the man of
humble and contrite spirit who trembles at my word.
<b>Isaiah 66:2</b>

We are four poor women, without letters, without lustre
and with the sole name of Servants of the Poor, not yet
worthy to be called Servants of God. Let us persevere in
the vocation to which we have been called.
<b>Unabridged Rule 237</b>
So with you: when you have done all you have been told
to do, say, "We are merely servants: we have done no
more than our duty."
<b>Luke 17:10</b>

The Institute is dedicated to the perfect exercise of the
Commandments of Love and to the special imitation of
Jesus Christ Crucified who breathes nothing but Charity.
The Lord requests Charity and mutual union.
<b>Unabridged Rule 243</b>
The life I now live in this body I live in faith: faith in the
Son of God who loved me and who sacrificed himself for
my sake.
<b>Galatians 2:20</b>

The Divine Mercy, through the merits of Mary Most Holy,
will not allow the Institute to take root rather than to do
so without the spirit of Charity, which is that of Jesus
Christ.
<b>Unabridged Rule 245</b>
To the One who loves us and has washed away our sins
with his blood, be glory and power forever and ever.
Amen.
<b>Revelation 1:4</b>

Jesus recommended charity immediately after the Insti-
tution of the Divine Sacrament in which, besides other
things, he had wanted to signify by the very matter of the
sacrament, the union of hearts which he asks of His
Christians. 
<b>Unabridged Rule 245</b>
Father, I have known you and I have made your name
known to them so that the love with which you loved me
may be in them and I in them.
<b>John 17:26</b>

Jesus commanded the Apostles to love one another as
He had loved them. This is the kind of love the Lord asks:
a real union of heart, one heart and one will.
<b>Unabridged Rule 246</b>
This is my commandment: love one another, as I have
loved you. You are my friends, I shall not call you servants
anymore.
<b>John 15:12</b>

They must love one another sincerely without any dis-
tinction, each one wanting what the other desires and
not wanting what displeases the other. The fact that the
Sisters come from different countries should not break
this union.
<b>Unabridged Rule 246</b>
Love is always patient and kind; it is not jealous; love is
never boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish.
<b>1 Corinthians 13,:4</b>

Do not speak badly, even in general, about other Nations.
Charity knows no other countries or boundaries except
those that lead from the imperfect practice of charity
here on earth to the perfect exercise of it in Heaven.
<b>Unabridged Rule 247</b>
Love does not take offense and is not resentful. Love
takes no pleasure in other people's sins but delights in
the truth. 
<b>1 Corinthians 13:5</b>

Let us observe how Jesus loved the Apostles. He loved
them although they were ignorant, full of defects, rough,
poor and timid. If we look at how much He has loved us,
we discover He loved us though ungrateful.
<b>Unabridged Rule 207</b>
Charity is ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to en-
dure whatever comes. There are three things that last:
faith, hope and love; the greatest is love. 
<b>1 Corinthians 13:7</b>

We must love one another with all our hearts, never giv-
ing a bad interpretation to the action of others but al-
ways giving the interpretation in conformity to charity,
never thinking and reflecting on hurts received.
<b>Unabridged Rule 247</b>
If I have the gift of prophecy and have faith in all its ful-
ness to move mountains, but without love, I am nothing
at all.
<b>1 Corinthians 13:3</b>

It was one of the feasts of Christmastide when, for the
first time and to my great surprise, I saw, but not with my
bodily eyes, the Holy Infant. This vision left me with a
strong feeling of love. What I saw, remained always im-
pressed in my soul.
<b>Memoirs  VIII, 1</b>
The Word was made flesh, He lived among us, and we
saw His glory, the glory that is His as the Only Son of the
Father, full of grace and truth.
<b>John 1:14</b>

We do not uphold our opinion, boast about the work we
have been entrusted with, interrupt the conversation and
much less use harsh, bitter or mortifying words; not one
word against Charity.
<b>Unabridged Rule 249</b>
"Today a Saviour has been born to you, he is Christ the
Lord ... peace to men who enjoy his favour." As for Mary
she pondered all this in her heart.
<b>Luke 2:11</b>

We must be careful to keep our heart steadfast in Charity
and our tongue silenced of every complaint. We must
never speak with resentment or uncontrolled emotion to
each other or use injurious words. 
<b>Unabridged Rule 253</b>
The Wise Men saw the Child with his Mother Mary, and
falling on their knees they did him homage. Opening their
treasures, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense
and myrrh.
<b>Matthew 2:11</b>

We must bear with one another and when a Sister asks
forgiveness, the other will always reply gently and cor-
dially, showing and really forgiving any offense or hurt.
<b>Unabridged Rule 254</b>
"My child, why have you done this to us? See how wor-
ried your father and I have been, looking for you." "Did
you not know that I must be busy with my Father's af-
fairs?"
<b>Luke 2:48</b>

For those of a certain age, we must show a special re-
spect, thanking them because they opened up the way.
Let us hold dear our sick Sisters, like mountains of gems,
and serve them with love. 
<b>Unabridged Rule 254</b>
Jesus lived under their authority. His Mother stored up all
these things in her heart. Jesus grew in wisdom, age and
favour with God and men. 
<b>Luke 2:51</b>

Mutual understanding and universal affection without
distinction are recommended to all. If someone should
fail in charity towards another person, he/she must ask
forgiveness and be reconciled at least before going to
bed.
<b>Unabridged Rule 52</b>
My prayer is that your love for each other may increase
more and more and never stop improving in knowledge
and the perception of what is best.
<b>Philippians 1:9</b>

We are strictly bound more than anybody else to observe
the most perfect charity. It would be monstruous to ne-
neglect the observance of that Commandment and for
the fulfilment of which He wanted to die on the Cross.
<b>Unbridged Rule 51</b>
Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth ... it is the ri-
ghtful inheritance of the one who proved victorious; I will
be his God and he a son to me.
<b>Revelation 21:1.7</b>
