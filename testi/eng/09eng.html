                        <p> Next Friday, the seven first Fridays of the month begin in
honour of Our Lady of Sorrows, who became, in a special
way, Mother of Charity at the foot of the Cross, our
model, since we need always a greater spirit of charity.

love and the greatest of these is love! Search for this charity.

                        <p> God desires that we stay beneath the cross with His Holy
Mother. Meanwhile I pray that He may give you courage
and set you at peace. I would not like you to lose your
tranquillity. Take courage because you must be my support.

                        <p class=bibbia> May you be glorified a thousand times, O Virgin Mother
of God! We sing your praises because by the cross of
your Son we obtained Paradise.
